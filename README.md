<h2><u>About the projects</u></h2>
- This project has been entirely done my myself, no code has been duplicated from other coders.<br>
- All the project mentioned in this repo have been done in Google Colab i.e., the Notebook format of Python.<br>
- But, both the formats of .ipynb and .py have been uploaded in the respective folders.<br>
- Can check the readme file of respective folders for each project info.<br>

<h2><u>Future scope</u></h2>
- To add projects on Deep Learning and unsupervised algorithm based projects<br>
