## About the project.
- This project has been entirely done my myself, no code has been duplicated from other coders.
- All the project mentioned in this repo have been done in Google Colab i.e., the Notebook format of Python.
- But, both the formats of .ipynb and .py have been uploaded in the respective folders.
- Can check the readme file of respective folders for each project info.

## Future scope

- To add projects on Deep Learning and unsupervised algorithm based projects
